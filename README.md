1. Why ``python`` ? Because python is lightweight and high perfomance program and simple language to be used. Since python is interpreter, it enables i am to code "perfectly" so errors or bugs can be minimized.
2. Why ``Flask`` ? Flask is like Node.JS/Express in Javascript, it's simple server framework tools. Easy to configure.
